abstract = {The application of induction plasma technology developed for the synthesis of nanometric powders is summarized. A brief description of the scientific basis for the induction plasma processes is given, followed by the presentation of an induction plasma system developed by Tekna, together with various examples of the nanopowders synthesized using its facilities. The advantages of the induction plasma process over alternative techniques and its adaptability into industrial-scale operation is particularly illustrated. Some specific issues related to the nanopowder synthesis process are also discussed.},

@book{F.F.Chen1989,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Hopwood1993,
abstract = {In this work a planar, radio frequency induction plasma source is characterized in terms of ion
density, electron temperature, and plasma potential using a single Langmuir probe in oxygen
and noble gases. Probe measurements of density were also verified using microwave
interferometry. Measured argon ion densities increase nearly linearly with power from 1 X lOll
cm - J at 300 W rf power to 6 X 10$\backslash$1 cm - 3 at 1.2 k W at 1 X 10 - 3 Torr. Krypton ion densities
are also linear with power but saturate above 1 kW at a density of 2 X 1012 cm - 3 at 1 X 10 - 3
Torr. Electron temperatures increase with decreasing pressure from 3 e V at 26 X 10 - 3 Torr to
7 eV at 0.3 X 10 - 3 Torr. Plasma potentials are typically 15-30 V and increase with decreasing
pressure. Ion saturation current in oxygen at 5 X 10 - 3 Torr is 2.5{\%} uniform over diagonals of
20 cm when a magnetic multipole bucket is used to confine the plasma. Ion generation energy
cost in argon is 100-250 WI A.},
