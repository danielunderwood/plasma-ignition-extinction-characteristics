abstract = {The application of induction plasma technology developed for the synthesis of nanometric powders is summarized. A brief description of the scientific basis for the induction plasma processes is given, followed by the presentation of an induction plasma system developed by Tekna, together with various examples of the nanopowders synthesized using its facilities. The advantages of the induction plasma process over alternative techniques and its adaptability into industrial-scale operation is particularly illustrated. Some specific issues related to the nanopowder synthesis process are also discussed.},
